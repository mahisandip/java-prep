 * Alice is a kindergarten teacher. She wants to give some candies to the children in her class.
 * All the children sit in a line and each of them has a rating score according to his or her performance in the class.
 * Alice wants to give at least 1 candy to each child. If two children sit next to each other, then the one with the
 * higher rating must get more candies. Alice wants to minimize the total number of candies she must buy.
 * For example, assume her students' ratings are [4, 6, 4, 5, 6, 2].
 * She gives the students candy in the following minimal amounts: [1, 2, 1, 2, 3, 1].
 * She must buy a minimum of 10 candies.
